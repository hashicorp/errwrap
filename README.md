# errwrap

`errwrap` is a package for Go that formalizes the pattern of wrapping errors
and checking if an error contains another error.

There is a common pattern in Go of taking a returned `error` value and
then wrapping it (such as with `fmt.Errorf`) before returning it. The problem
with this pattern is that you completely lose the original `error` structure.

Arguably the _correct_ approach is that you should make a custom structure
implementing the `error` interface, and have the original error as a field
on that structure, such [as this example](http://golang.org/pkg/os/#PathError).
This is a good approach, but you have to know the entire chain of possible
rewrapping that happens, when you might just case about one.

`errwrap` formalizes this pattern (it doesn't matter what approach you use
above) by giving a single interface for wrapping errors, checking if a specific
error is wrapped, and extracting that error.
